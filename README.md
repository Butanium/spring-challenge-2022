# Spring Challenge 2022

My Python bot for the [codingame spring challenge 2002](https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/spring-challenge-2022)

## Bot description

This bot tries to defend the base by tracking enemy attackers. I wanted to do something different from just 2 defenders
and an attacker which seems to be the meta.

The bot can be very good if it successfully pushes spiders far away from the attacker.

If it is pushed too hard it has to defend inside the base and loose a lot of wild mana.
