# Spring Challenge 2022

My Python submission for this [codingame challenge](https://www.codingame.com/ide/challenge/spring-challenge-2022)

## What's done ?

For now, I only implemented naive defense which doesn't care about the enemy.

## What's next ?

- Make an adaptative defense that can handle attackers
- Attack the enemy with mana advantage or optimize wild mana gain
